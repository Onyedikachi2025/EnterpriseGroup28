# Spotify Dataset Analysis Report
## Introduction
This report aims to analyse a dataset containing various songs on Spotify. The data represents both popular and unpopular songs on this streaming platform, taken from users’ listening data. These specific kinds of datasets are interesting as it allows us to determine what characteristics in music users tend to gravitate toward; and what they are more inclined to drift away from. The goal of our analysis is to find out what are the songs, albums or artists of the highest frequency, mentioned in the table.

## Dataset Overview
We obtained our dataset to use for our analysis from Kaggle. It features structured information about the music available on Spotify including both metadata from Spotify and audio features of the songs themselves. The dataset is designed to aid analysis of music trends and explore common audio features. The overall dataset includes 1686 rows and 30 columns of data. Each row represents a single track while each column represents a feature of the track that can be meaured in some way. These variables include a mix of categorical and numerical data including variables such as the track name or ID, the artists' names, the albums off which the tracks are from, their popularity rating, the tempo and duration, and many more different variables. Most of the core variables are generated by Spotify's own audio analysis algorithms and are useful for analysis and machine learning as they are already standardised and scaled in the majority of cases.  

## Data Cleaning Summary
When performing that data cleaning, we focused in on columns which contain attributes such liveness, danceability and track popularity. First we used the trim command to get rid for any data that is missing. However there was no null pieces of data within our dataset. Next, we removed any columns that we didn't need for our analysis, and kept columns such as track, artist, track duration, etc. We then got the average, min, max, standard deviation, mode and the median for these 3 attributes. To find the max and min of our dataset columns, we used the MAX() and MIN() commands. Similarly, we used the correlating commands for the mean, mode and median. To find the standard deviation of our main attributes, we used the command SDEV.P() as we are finding the standard deviation of the population of data within the dataset. Lastly, we got rid of the URL and the link for our dataset as it was not needed for our analysis


## Descriptive Statistics Explanation
When talking about the mean, anything above 50 (mainly the track popularity) is on average the most liked and anything below that is on average less liked. For the liveness popular chart we see it have a rate 0.95 for the max, correlating to This Love by Maroon 5, which suggests people enjoyed it more then other compared to the lowest rated which was 0.021, correlating to Oxlade by Ku Lo Sa. Next we will look at the track popularity with the genre, Pop displays the highest number, meaning the majority of people liked and listen to this genre of music. The lowest was Jazz, meaning people find it the least enjoyable compared to other genres. To explain the danceability statistics, it means which genre would people be most likely to dance to. For example, 2.813% of people would be more likely to dance to music in the Indie genre. The top 30 displays the 30 most popular songs amongst the population.

### Top 30 Best Songs – Popularity

This graph shows the popularity of the top 30 songs .The line goes up and down a lot which means some songs are much more popular than others .The high points mean that the song is very popular and the low means that the song is still in the top 30 but not that popular. It shows that only a few songs have a very high popularity, and the rest are lower.


## Basic Machine Learning
As part of the Spotify playslist dataset analysis report, we used a machine learning prediction table to analyse how accurately gneres could be predicted for top Spotify tracks. We used Sourcetable to analyse. The table included the track artist, album, playlist genre, predicted genre, and whether the predicted gebre matched the playlist genre. In total 40 tracks were analysed . The predicted genre matched the playlist genre for 28 tracks, while it did not match for 12. This suggest that the match learning model has a reasonable level of accurancy, but its not always corect. Overall, this shows that machine learning can be useful for predicting music genres, it may require more data to increase accurancy . 

## Limitations and Ethics
Machine Learning can help predict music genres on Spotify, but it has some limits and ethics concern. It only looks at features like tempo, energy, and dancability , so it can miss a song's meaning or feeling . Small datsets and songs with more than one genre can make predictions wrong. 
Popular songs may get recommended more , while new or small songs artists get less attention. So I think machine learning is useful but must be used carefully.
