# Spotify Dataset Analysis Report
## Introduction
This report aims to analyse a dataset containing various songs on Spotify. The data represents both popular and unpopular songs on this streaming platform, taken from users’ listening data. These specific kinds of datasets are interesting as it allows us to determine what characteristics in music users tend to gravitate toward; and what they are more inclined to drift away from. The goal of our analysis is to...

## Dataset Overview
We obtained our dataset to use for our analysis from Kaggle. It features structured information about the music available on Spotify including both metadata from Spotify and audio features of the songs themselves. The dataset is designed to aid analysis of music trends and explore common audio features. The overall dataset includes 4833 rows and 30 columns of data. Each row represents a single track while each column represents a feature of the track that can be meaured in some way. These variables include a mix of categorical and numerical data including variables such as the track name or ID, the artists' names, the albums off which the tracks are from, their popularity rating, the tempo and duration, and many more different variables. Most of the core variables are generated by Spotify's own audio analysis algorithms and are useful for analysis and machine learning as they are already standardised and scaled in most cases.

## Basic Machine Learning
As part of the spotify playlist dataset analysis report , we conducted a machine learning predicted spotify data table analysis to analyse the predictions that machine learning can make based on the top spotify tracks . The source that we used to carry out this analysis was Sourcetable, a prediction machine learning website which was a reliable tool for creating a prediction table for the spotify data analysis. This table contains dara and the predicted genre based on machine learning about spotify tracks, including the track artist, track album, playlist genre, predicted genre, and whether the predicted genre matches the playlist genre. in total we analysed 40 tracks in the table.The predicted genre matched the playlist genre for 28 tracks, when it did niot match 12 tracks. 
this indicates that the machine learning model used for genre prediction has a certain level of accurancy . however, there are also instances where it did not corectly predict the genre based on the playlist genre. overall this shows that while machine learning can be useful for predicting music genres, it is mnot always completely accurate and may requirw more data or improved algorithm to improve results.
